Vladislav Kleiman & Michael Dombrovsky: Meme game
Project Structure:5/10
HTML Structure:7/10
CSS and Design: 6/10
JS and DOM: 7/10
Clarity: 0/10
score: 6
It is a nice game and I can see the knowledge behind it in the script, but the logic of the scores is not clear. 
Also design is divided in the CSS without comments or instructions. 
the HTML structure is decent, with clear sections and good use of semantics. 
However, there are areas, like resource optimization, inline styling, and inline JavaScript, that could be improved.
